# metview

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) provides the metview software package which can be used to inspect, analyse, process and visualze meteorological data. ECMWF also provides a Python interface for it. We have created a simple Docker image to make use of the [metview bundle](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/The+Metview+Source+Bundle) and prepare the Python bindings. This Dockerfile compiles the metview package for non-interactive use.
